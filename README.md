# Voting System Using Blockchain

A brief description of what this project does is given below :-

# Abstract

On the internet we have one big issue and that issue is 'trust issue'. The aspect of security and transparency is a threat with the conventional voting system.By adopting blockchain in the distribution of databases on e-voting systems can reduce one of the cheating sources of database manipulation.

# Project overview

Implementing the voting system is not always been an easy task in the blockchain. Still, it's possible to implement and keep supreme the authenticity of the voter and determine the eligibility of the voter. The user would receive a key or a token. This token will help the voter to exactly cast his/her vote for a single time. That means no multiple voting is allowed under blockchain voting practice. We can surely say that blockchain technology stops 'double spending'.

# Languages 

 We have  used the following languages Node js, Truffle, MySQL.
 
 # Steps 

We will create a user using the command create username as bbs at localhost identified with MySQL native password and give passward strong one with alphanumeric symbol uppercase ,lowercase and note this username and passward must match with the one in our orm config.json so do check it after creating the user and Database is created.

Now we can open Ganache create new workspace name it as test and add truffle config the json from backend then ganache is ready.Now next step is migrate our smart contract using truffle migrate inside backend it is depolying and we got four block minr on ganache.

next we can initialize our database inside backend type npm run type orm migration colon run run our backend server type npm start.During this we need to add dot enb file add it

For frontend type npm start if we click on view words it shows waiting for election to start login with our admin. We can create poll verify usersand we got profile section.create a poll for president and start election on our gunners we can 7 block mind
